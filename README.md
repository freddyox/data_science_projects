# Data Science Projects
Each directory within **data_science_projects/** represents a project in which different tools or algorithms are used to 
solve an interesting real-world problem.

## Directories
* **titanic_kaggle**: An analysis-chain for the Titanic competition, and the goal is to make survival predictions
                       based on passenger information. An accuracy of roughly 90% is achieved using a Random Forest model.
* **old_faithful**: Predicting the waiting time for an Old Faithful eruption given the most recent eruption time 
                    using K-means clustering.
* **text_classification_v2**: Classifying text documents into one of eight categories where a linear support 
                              vector machine algorithm yields an accuracy of roughly 97% on the test set.
* **ca_housing**: California housing predictions using a wide-variety of models and cross-validation techniques.
