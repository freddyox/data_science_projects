# Data Science Projects
Each directory within **data_science_projects/** represents a project in which different tools or algorithms are used to 
solve an interesting real-world problem.

## Directories
* **titanic_kaggle**: An analysis-chain for the Titanic competition, and the goal is to make survival predictions
                       based on passenger information. An accuracy of roughly 90% is achieved using a Random Forest model.
* **old_faithful**: Predicting the waiting time for an Old Faithful eruption given the most recent eruption time 
                    using K-means clustering.
* **text_classification_v2**: Classifying text documents into one of eight categories where a linear support 
                              vector machine algorithm yields an accuracy of roughly 97% on the test set.
* **ca_housing**: California housing predictions using a wide-variety of models and cross-validation techniques.
* **billboard_topsongs**: Scraped artists/songs from <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2017/hot-100-songs">Billboard's year-end top 100</a>, which includes songs from 2006-2017. Scraped the lyrics from <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> using their API; the text went through a cleansing routine at this stage. Explored and analyzed the text.
* **nyc_rentals**: Based on a competition that may be seen <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries#description">here</a>, which includes classifying the desirability of NYC rental properties given a variety of features. A random forest algorithm is applied in a separate python script, and the data is not included due to the file size.
